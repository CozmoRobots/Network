This is the base code for getting Cozmo to listen to messages from the chat server
Read the program to understand the logic
Modify the program to have Cozmo either move location, move the head, or the tractor arm
depending on the message sent.  A message to move should be of the form 'name;FB;LR;distX;distY'
and a message for head/tractor arm should be of the form 'headValue;tractorValue'
